/**
 * Implementation of the network interface for use by classes implementing TaskExecutor
 * inside mongod.
 *
 * This implementation manages a dynamically sized group of worker threads for performing
 * network operations.  The minimum and maximum number of threads is set at compile time, and
 * the exact number of threads is adjusted dynamically, using the following two rules.
 *
 * 1.) If the number of worker threads is less than the maximum, there are no idle worker
 * threads, and the client enqueues a new network operation via startCommand(), the network
 * interface spins up a new worker thread.  This decision is made on the assumption that
 * spinning up a new thread is faster than the round-trip time for processing a remote command,
 * and so this will minimize wait time.
 *
 * 2.) If the number of worker threads has exceeded the the peak number of scheduled outstanding
 * network commands continuously for a period of time (kMaxIdleThreadAge), one thread is retired
 * from the pool and the monitoring of idle threads is reset.  This means that at most one
 * thread retires every kMaxIdleThreadAge units of time.  The value of kMaxIdleThreadAge is set
 * to be much larger than the expected frequency of new requests, averaging out short-duration
 * periods of idleness, as occur between heartbeats.
 *
 * The implementation also manages a pool of network connections to recently contacted remote
 * nodes.  The size of this pool is not bounded, but connections are retired unconditionally
 * after they have been connected for a certain maximum period.
 * TODO(spencer): Rename this to ThreadPoolNetworkInterface
